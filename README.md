# pymaceuticals_challenge
In this challenge, I analyzed data of the effects of anti-cancer medications tested on mice. The data includes information on 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

I used the aid of online resources, tutors, and learning assistants to complete the challenge. I used online documentation on Pandas and Matplotlib as well as ChatGPT to assist in writing the code and troubleshooting.
